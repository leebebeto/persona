you have given me so much
i feel what is been lost

just repossess my 4 x 4
all the things that we accept
I am just protecting my soul
this is my type of thing
its more than just your mind
wrist so blinding heart so timeless
my heart can not possibly break
the candy sweetness scent of you
and sooner or later its over
how long will i need you
I am living for that day
tell me what can i say
listen when we talk ooh yeah
she can bring him such misery
as you turn around and say
baby i just need one night
watching as the flames get higher
and she gave him some head
put yo back on tha wall
space and time in the afterlife
but the chords i was confused
you will never be alone oh
wreckin ball dancin down the hallway
have to do something about it
will not you come its emergency
years ago and well you know
you should be picking me up
neither one of us would budge
I have got a cute face
i swore i would be true
was always tearing at the seams
thought there would be no pressure
and i will swallow my pride
i feel like a better man
i would not turn on you
i look up from the ground
and comin apart at the seams
if you should ever leave me
I am a ripe old age
has got a hold on me
I am jealous of the rain
that you never should have made
but one day ill be gone
lay your body close to mine
and you just stay lined up
come on now follow my lead
lover come to the kitchen floor
were far from the shallow now
til you made up your mind
I am tired of being alone
i want to raise your spirits
they told me its all written
do you remember when we met
maybe its all a big mistake
i are not worried bout nothin
look inside you and be strong
and your hearts on the ground
all this tension let it go
done talk through 3 or 4 songs already
a girl runs up with somethin to prove
who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
just stylishing cars cuz they all true nig
its hard to creep since i found joe
but without no money its still a wish

and sip the cris and get pissy pissy

and leave me with my pride
I am chilling on the sofa
we on fiya we on fiya

and how come its so hard
an act of antigravity set free
got me feeling something brand new
in a house on the street

now you want to be free
not like its hurt me before
you are laying waste to halloween
no matter what my friends say
and that tonight ill call ya
is knowing you might be right

and knowing that you love will
cock back cock back trigger release
that you had five more minutes
families never crumble in a day
i hope that you are well
forget what i used to know
and well have halloween on christmas
i do not believe that anybody
and then a hero comes along
the punchline that got too old
all the voices in my mind
is there nothing you can say
do not have to be cool
falling behind in what could be
yes I am here to listen
and I am still standing here
paddock paddock icicle let it go
but when you are near me
feel the heartbeat in my mind
let me down let me down
but you can sell your soul
yeah you cover up my scars
and beg you from her knees
oh i got you seeing double
keep your head up my love
thought id end up with sean
maybe together we can get somewhere
one mile to every inch of
leave your clothes at the door

you grow in the ghetto living second rate
you can see a lot in this lifespan
although my heart is falling too
always having your hand to hold
I am in love with you
women not girls rule my world
i pray in you ill find
now I am done with that
kingdoms have fallen angels be calling
stop me and steal my breath
but if you look for truthfulness
careful not to start no trouble
to get a little love back
and my feet start to thump
something in your voice had changed
come back i still need you
tell me right now baby baby
paint wetter than a lake yup
you will never play my love
shake your booty shake your booty
if i see you next to never
do not need surgery you are perfect
too many chugs ill be passing out
and well dance until the morning comes
i just can not keep hanging on
that were making two reflections into one
the only one who satisfies my soul
someone who can live and love you
whenever were not close to one another
where do you think you are goin
and i knew that from the beginning
ill wait for the moment to dissipate
what can make me feel this way
loving you was sunshine safe and sound
ay do not sleep do not sleep
because you know you give me something
no angel but you got a halo
hail a cab at for the airport
i got caught up in the forest
were the rebel kids the lucky ones
and I am giving all i have
i want you to stay with me
but that are not what you want
no one else can make me feel
rolling ocbs on the side for me
yes when a man loves a woman
but I am good at getting gone
I am the king of the castle
how could i make you love me
when were living out in the sun
that is the beautiful thing about us
even the wrong words seem to rhyme
i laughed and climbed the rising cast
oh dance through the blisters at night
I am frightened as much as you
i wear my heart like my tattoos
when i need you baby everything stops
radios playing songs for me and you
where I have been waiting for years
I am not asking for a lot
she is the pain and the medicine
if i could just see you tonight
stay with me while we grow old
if we could see in twenty twin
want to grab on and hold tight
now i can not stop looking around
see i believe in money power and respect
you can not play wit my yoyo sucka
and party people in the house sing it
you should have seen this girls bodily dimensions

and that is realer than real deal holyfield
and I am down to get the friction on
hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
there are few things that is forever my lady
for the weekend hittin ls while I am sleeping
heres another point in life you should not miss
now i got  a man comin on right now
mobbin like a muhfucker but i are not lynchin
did not even get no static from the cowards
so please listen to the message that i say
supersonic is a word when people start to listen
its on you so what you going to do
with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
gettin head from girls that used to hardly speak
but yo guess who got shot in the domepiece
the sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
I am a bad motherfucker and you know this
he touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
thugs pimps and pushers and the big money makers
handcuffed in back of a bus forty of us
and i do get better the voice gets wetter
lil jon and the east side boyz wit me
jig wit it cuz ship crisp split it all
are not known for frontin vouch for my behavior
life as a shorty should not be so ruff
the sun roof was open  the music was high
ruthless never seen like a shadow in the dark
i dedicate this to you for believing in me
d nuh nana nana nana no we did not
me i be diggin it with the bump verse
i got a blunt up in my right hand
or maybe you just need to treat her better
well its kind of simple just remain your own
I am not a doctor put them in rapture
then he made his move to an abandoned building
that the ones we hurt are you and me
she said what is wrong this shirt cost 20
say she like to think about cuttin in restrooms
when i awake i do not see the motherfucker
says she watches to much is just not healthy
living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
pretendtobe cats do not seem to know they limitation
but I am not the only one
all we have is here and now
now that your rose is in bloom
come come on now follow my lead
no trace no residual feelings within ya
because I have never been so high
and there was something behind those eyes
five hundred twentyfive thousand six hundred minutes
got trust issues I am not flawless
come here ill show you it hurts
as long as you want me to
and be too much sometimes i know
through the storm we reach the shore
all my mistakes are slowly drowning me
oh you know i do not mind
we keep this love in a photograph
you get the best of my love
when I am here in my arms
i just had to let you know
baby take me serious mmhmm mmhmm hmm
and wears her heart on her sleeve
be the one to start a fight
let me hold a couple dollars nope
put that spotlight on her face spotlight
i know you moved onto someone new
find a limb to hang your clothes
so many thoughts lemme drown em out
with the way that you spoke here
you left me broken like a record
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
and my voice becomes the driving force
you know id fall apart without you
just to get to you my dear
and i know that I am free
and we have all ended up fine
said i do not my baby baby
press and the road and the music
because two heads are better than one
cross my heart and hope to die
and that are not what you need
so they could watch the full moon
and I am doing everything i can
inside these pages you just hold me
if you give me some time listen
something in her style that shows me
and mostly what i need from you
I have been sitting here for ages
smart woman who knows how to flirt
hell nah you trippin reevaluate your life
so i prophesied as i was commanded
do not wait til i do wrong
I am right here yeah oh yeah
oh did i give enough of mine
i would be lying if i said
do not be shy with your features
starting from zero got nothing to lose
sprint spread love or nigga kick rocks
thinking bout what you are gon do
some kind of night into your darkness
only for life let us get it
on the sunday morning music real loud
and loves an honest one to make
but she reminds me nothing of you
you can put it on my tab
i handle mine just like a real nigga should
either work hard or you might as well quit
or how bout on the beach with black sand
pick it up pick it up pick it up
feelin out of place cuz man do i miss
if you choose to fuck around you get bruised
in front of big lous fighting in the street
and now I am going to do my dance
say what is up to herb ice and bullet
a child is born wih no state of mind
and pump up the funky beat a whole week
but give the man a taste and hes gone
i do not know but today seems kinda odd
when opp comes damn skippy I am with it
I am on the radio and at the jam
ready to boogie i had on my dancin shoes
she had 910 pants and a very big bra
rock rock to the planet rock do not stop
its not about a salary its all about reality
oh she is a gold digger way over town
she take my money when I am in need
but maintain when you come home the corners ours
you are rhymin and stealin with the freshest ale
got juice told your lady oops we nuts baby
i loved you slim we could have been together
destroyin a ploy when your rhymes are not void
everything is fine when you listenin to the dog
a lot of suckas would like to forget me
pop da pop pop ya do not dare stop
because funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
rubbin your spot love got you screamin punish me
this is my philosophy many artists got to learn
for kids in kansas to those who speak spanish
and if i ever get caught i make bail

you saw the best there was in me
like a river flows surely to the sea
i know exactly what i need to do
yeah and love is all that i need
even though i know its been so distant
but long as there are stars above you
there is a tiny little room for two
that you need you build to keep afloat
that I am laying right next to you
truth is i can not hide from you
here we go now here we go now
tryna do what lovers do do uhh ooh

because my love is bleeding and slightly bruised
there must be a boy for this girl
ill pour my heart out through my mouth
all of the nights you came to me
someone help us because were doing our best
ill build your dreams with these two hands
it took some time for me to see
from the lives that have always been close
her skirts blown back hands to the fore
vines at the bottom of an olive grove
and so you are finishing up your coffee
fucking on another nigga that is negative alone
can i handle the seasons of my life
wan give it to ya physically and metaphysically
she is the flint that sparks the lighter
i was so scared to face my fears
she may be the beauty or the beast
if you ever want to be in love
every little piece every little part of me
britney with the twin and the girl ashley
but big punisher still got what you are lookin for
label me as a woman and sometimes i feel inferior
keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
I am poppin in the clip when the wind blows
it was plain to see that your life was lost
i really hate to trip but i got to loc
but i are not going out like no punk bitch
tha block is hot tha block is hot ha haha
I have dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
there was no way for me to avoid being grounded
that most of these cats is featherweight let me demonstrate
salt n pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
music turned all the way up and to the maximum
the cop got scared the kid he starts to figure
last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
now all you supersonic people try to bite our rhyme
and I am asking the good lord why and sigh
all ya had to do was give humpty a chance
showin much flex when its time to wreck a mic
do not bother dissin me or even wish that wed
now bitch swallow it up while i shut it down

you can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle
because around the same time i went away to school
a  been sippin on the hennessey and the gin again
and find that i am the baby of the bunch
at night i can not sleep i toss and turn
the question at hand is how do i love thee
can not manage the truth until you buy a way
are not in the mood to be singing no blues
so now i dwell just to say you are plainer
brooklyn new york city where they paint murals of biggie
i need money i used to be a stickup kid
but before i could bust a rhyme on the mic
but the rhythm will still guide you through the night
but if not it will be me on the floor
keep an eye out for jake shorty wop one love
the tour was over and she went back to school

so if you want to be a little disco ducka
who wants to bar fight who wants to bar fight
I am rollin for lana dripped in gabbana 90s style
you drippy nose knucklehead you are we behind the ears
but one that is smart for me is more suitable
if you were to rule or govern a certain industry
i guess they can not i guess they will not
imma get this bank anyway that i do this shit
called up the homies and I am askin you all
i said come on make the make the people move
now who can stop the music runnin through these veins
while you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
then you know i can not remember a damn thing
just me and my boy and we sayin oh boy
you plant the flowers ill plant the kisses
and that is enough for me to try
bring it to da front girl go go
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
I am wondering who you lay next to
does she love you better than i can
she is the sweetest thing that i know
there is nobody no one to outrun me
and I am wondering what you are dreaming
I am not your macho kind of guy
and i hope there is enough for you
it does not matter put the phone away
show me the field you danced in clover
i can have security until the bitter end
keeps me warm right to my very soul
how she grinding tryin fi keep mi out
every day you are here I am healing
and you give me all all of you
my celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
we look them right into their octopi eyes
i fail to connect its a tragic divide
can not see the stars but were reaching
please do not fall in love without me
whenever I am wrong whenever I am wrong
7 billion oh oh oh oh oh oh
i know that i think about it sometimes
i know that life will not break me
my life and love might still go on
and when you are feeling blue i know
but i know you in the worst way

moments like those lord knows id hit it
but they would only remind me of you

ooh babe i want to carry your books
crawling back home id do anything for you
for years and years and years and years
because even though i need a new start

just the two of us no one else invited
trying to get through the dark on a feeling
with you in my bed you in my bed
what it is that will not let me go
its the look in your eyes that told me
no rules no plans this is all for us
you are still the one i want for life
it would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
because drunk me can not get over you no
and until then ill smile to hide the truth
hoping that id run into you one last time
you pressed about that nigga what your friends say
one of them gets to climb down your wrist
and waste the chance that I have been given
because baby we are not got nothing without love
so now i got the world in my hand
now i know all the wrong turns the stumbles
what i need them for when i got you
but i can not make you see it through
tell them to put it out on the air
waiting for that moment when you find your way
so call out my name call out my name

o why do not you stay around for awhile
i know he would better be good to you
i never thought your love was worth its wait
I am going to pull up on you shawty

i feel like I am standing with an army
i never will forget the way you look tonight
i wandered around and finally found that somebody who
see i can not change the way things are
got me hoping you will save me right now
and his arms a little bit longer than me
when it stops when it stops when it stops
are not you tired tryin to fill that void
its all brand new I am crazy for you

I am much too old to break free and run
i do not know how you do what you do
but i just want to tell you I am sorry

i feel so cold and i long for your embrace
and I have been there before and that lifes a bore
you got a look that says you got it all together
i work hard he works hard every day of my life
you are just making sure I am never gettin over you
some people think that the physical things define what is within
but each time i try i just break down and cry
baby I am the gasoline and your kiss is the spark
turn around bright eyes every now and then i fall apart
can i just have one more moondance with you my love
and they were right but i can not help looking back
man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
feel the wind and the fire hold the pain deep inside
maybe that is the reason that you talk in your sleep
though I have tried to resist being last on your list
do not know what she been on i do not know
i want real love baby there is a world inside me
this romeo is bleeding but you can not see his blood
slip your hand in my back pocket in my back pocket
if i can not have you let love set you free
darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
i wanted you to know i love the way you laugh
but with you I have learned just to let it out
and now I am all up on ya what you expect

i said maybe you are going to be the one that saves me
and then i go and tell my people and they already know him

you do not make it ring ring ring ring you do not make it ring baby
oh i know i know i know you think its me because you want it all
i do not even care if you are going to be the death of me me me
I am not moving and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i could be
but henry is my baby boy and everyone he meets he gives a wink and a smile
i do not mean to be but I have just got to tell you how i feel
oh at the end of the day I am going to still keep it true true true
you got me thinking bout when you were mine you got me thinking bout when you were mine
you know what i give up let me go get my gun i got one in the chamber
well I have been waiting for this moment for all my life oh lord oh lord oh lord
oh well go back well go back to the beginning and well pickup on the trails of forgotten ways
but you just do not know how it feels to have somebody that you can share your whole life
i can take the weight up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
